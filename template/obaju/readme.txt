*Everything is kept simple so you should not have any problems implementing the template. I will try to answer few of the possible questions below.*



**Changing the colour of the theme**

Every colour variant has its appropriate stylesheets located in the /css directory. To change the colour of the template simply change the path in the header of the HTML template i.e. from *style.default.css* to *style.pink.css*. 

**Modifying template**

For your custom modifications please use custom.css stylesheet. The reason for this is to avoid possible interferences with template updates in the future. 


**Javascript**

Apart from Bootstrap JS components majority of JS is located in /js/front.js. In this file you can change the settings of the carousels, animations etc. 

**Google Maps**

Google maps are used on the contact page. If you need just to show location of the company on the map, the only neccessary thing is to change coordinates in the header of contact.html. For further settings and possibilities please consult [Google Maps API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/).

Thank you for downloading!

Ondrej
